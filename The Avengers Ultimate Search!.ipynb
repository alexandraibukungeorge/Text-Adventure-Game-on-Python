    "Welcome to The Avengers Ultimate Search, an immersive text adventure game plunging you into the heart of the Marvel Universe. Heavily inspired by Marvel’s blockbuster films Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame — both rooted in Jim Starlin’s legendary 1992 limited-edition comic series The Infinity Gauntlet — this game invites you to stand alongside Earth’s mightiest heroes in a mission that will decide the fate of the cosmos.\n",

    "Your recruitment by Nick Fury is no accident. You possess a rare mutation enabling you to copy and adapt any superhuman ability encountered. Harness this power well. You must embark on perilous missions across three distant planets to find Thanos and secure three of the five Infinity Rings—Mind, Soul, and Time. While Spider-Man has safeguarded three rings already, these final three remain critical to preventing the Mad Titan from reshaping reality on a catastrophic scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout your journey, you’ll be guided by J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark’s cutting-edge AI. Survive his quips and trials, and you just might return with the rings needed to thwart Thanos’s grand plan. Every planet holds new dangers and fresh chances to unleash your powers. The universe watches, Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Luck. The Avengers are counting on you. Now, gear up, and let the quest begin!\n"
